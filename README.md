# Dispositivos_decodificados
Projeto de Dispositivos decodificados ultiizando o micrcontrolador 80c51

In this project , there is an example of a project, where is used the 80c51 micrcontroler, being part of embeded system, construct with the flollowing peripherals:
ADC converter;
Sixteen keyboard;
RS232 Peripeherals;
DAC converter;
RAM memory;
ROM memory;
Enter Keys;
Four Stteper motors, with the driver construct with the l297 and l298.

All of these peripherals are simulated using proteus sofwatre and the programs that make it is found on the document that there is the description of the board.

Suggestions:
Construct this borad is a great job for who wanted to training his skills in eletronic and eletrica, and more, in techinical courses of eletrically report.
